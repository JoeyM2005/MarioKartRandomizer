# Mario Kart Randomizer

This is created for almost anything choice-related in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Coded in Python and maybe other languages.

- Character Randomizer
- Kart/Wheel/Glider Randomizer
- Item Randomizer
- Course Randomizer

## TODO:
- How tf do you use github with vscode bruh???
- Fix logic for ensuring non-duplicates (chars, items, courses, etc.)
- Functions for each randomizer
- Fill with characters and change random to select from list
- Hopefully, each player could be a class with the kart parts as variables (also implement other classes for things)
  
- ### Start on website stuff
  Once website is working, work on more features such as:
  - Premade sets of items vs truly random
  - selectable randomness (user inputs number of random things)
