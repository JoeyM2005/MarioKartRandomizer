# Mario Kart Randomizer

This is created for almost anything choice-related in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Mario Kart World. Coded in Python and maybe other languages if we decide to.

- Character Randomizer
- Kart/Wheel/Glider Randomizer
- Item Randomizer
- Course Randomizer

### Not in website:
- For personal use there is a calculator file in the MK8DX folder so users can input scores and it will output to a file to keep track of scores in the txt file it saves

## TODO:
- Hopefully, each player could be a class with the kart parts as variables (also implement other classes for things)
