# Mario Kart Randomizer

This is created for almost anything choice-related in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Mario Kart World. Coded in Python and maybe other languages if we decide to.

- Character Randomizer
- Kart/Wheel/Glider Randomizer
- Item Randomizer
- Course Randomizer

### Not in website:
- For personal use there is a calculator file in the MK8DX folder so users can input scores and it will output to a file to keep track of scores in the txt file it saves

### Run through terminal:
1. I think you have to install python, but I'm not really sure because I already had python to begin with
2. Download the project to a zip file and unzip it
3. Open the terminal and copy and paste either the MK8DX command or MKWorld command
   - cd Downloads/MarioKartRandomizer-main\MarioKartRandomizer-main/MarioKart8DX
   - cd Downloads/MarioKartRandomizer-main\MarioKartRandomizer-main/MarioKartWorld
4. Copy and paste either the corresponding python run command for which game you selected previously
   - python MarioKart8DX.py
   - python MarioKartWorld.py

## TODO:
- Hopefully, each player could be a class with the kart parts as variables (also implement other classes for things)
